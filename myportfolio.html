		<center><p>The code shown above is the code for my app. The app is a duckhunter game where the objective is to shoot donald duck with the fighter jet. Me and my partner delivered a finish product and I personally believe that it is not bad for a first app.</P></center>

		<center><p>The code shown above was the code that me and my parnter wrote for our interactive fiction project. The story is quite long and absurd too. You begin with a normal quest to slay a dragon and have many questions such as your weapon of choice but then you may end up answering a question such as what should you name the band you started with your dragon. It ends with the main character(you) befriending the dragon instead of killing it which in my opinion is quite clever. We also put a few images in the code so depending on your answer, you might see a man with a bow and an arrow written in symbols or a dragon written in symbols.</p></center>

		<center><p>The simulation above is one of fireworks as I hope one can tell. I increased the number of fragments so there are more tails coming out of the fireworks. I also increased the x and y velocity so the single fireworks are moving faster, but I inreased the gravity to keep them on the screen. The fade amount is decreased which allows the little tails on the end of the fireworks to stream a little longer and gives me Jackson Pollock painting vibes.</p></center>
